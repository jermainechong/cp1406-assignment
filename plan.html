<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>The goal of this website is to increase the participation of young people playing Vollyball at Slammers by atleast 50%</p>
<h4>Success Evaluation</h4>
<p>In order to evaluate the success of this goal, statistics from the "sign-up" page will be analysed to determine how many new players are joining. Website views may also be considered to see how popular the site is, however, this will not be an accurate determining factor in terms of achieving the website's goal.</p>
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
<p>This website will target the Vollyball community but will be specifically aimed at young people who are interested on playing the sport. Taking this into consideration, my plan is to design the site to be as visually appealling as possible in order to keep young visitors interested. The site will feature tips from Vollyball profesionals, engaging imagery, clever fonts and plenty of information about Slammers.</p>
